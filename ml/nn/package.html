    <p>Here's a Neural Network implementation based on a course I took
    in college.  Neural Networks are designed to mimic some of the
    structural and functional features we see working in our own
    brains.  This particular kind of Neural Network is a vast
    simplification of our actual neural networks.  It's called a
    "back-propagation" neural network.  Despite being very simple, it
    can "learn" to identify complex relations in data that is used to
    "train" it.  Later, based on that training, it can identify the
    same complex relations in new data that it hasn't seen before, as
    long as the new data is vaguely similar to the old data.</p>

    <p>For instance, this kind of network can be trained to recognize
    faces in digital pictures.  I intend to write a demonstration of
    this soon.</p>
