<h1>Cache Throughput</h1>

<p>The following is a test of CPU cache data access performance.  The
test was meant to detect the optimal space available in the cache for
a dynamically allocated working set.  The hypothesis is that the
optimal working set size is significantly less than the full size of
the cache due to the extra overhead of the rest of the system's process
and even by the test itself.  If this is the case, it might be good to
have a rule-of-thumb for how much cache is available in a server
setting, e.g. &quot;assume you get only half the L2 cache&quot;.</p>

<h2>The CPUs</h2>

<h2>The Test</h2>

<p>The test that was run is linked below.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>These graphs show the throughput of the cache in the two tests.
Click on the graph for the data used to generate it.</p>

<p>The first test was on <em>sequential access</em> of an array of 2^N
bytes.  In this graph, the x-axis is N, the Y-axis is bytes/ms:
<img src="/~pablo/code/bench/cpu/cache/bench.png"/>
<a href="/~pablo/code/bench/cpu/cache/cpu1.txt">CPU1 data</a>
<a href="/~pablo/code/bench/cpu/cache/cpu2.txt">CPU2 data</a>
</p>

<p>The second test was on <em>random access</em> of an array of 2^N
bytes.  In this graph, the x-axis is N, the Y-axis is bytes/ms:
<img src="/~pablo/code/bench/cpu/cache/bench-rand.png"/>
<a href="/~pablo/code/bench/cpu/cache/cpu1-rand.txt">CPU1 data</a>
<a href="/~pablo/code/bench/cpu/cache/cpu2-rand.txt">CPU2 data</a>
</p>

<p>NOTE: The CPU's cache sizes are is 2^19 bytes (512KB) and 2^20
(1024KB) respectively.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Caches work just like they taught us in skool :)


<p>It is interesting to note that the maximal throughput rate is
achieved with a working set much smaller than the L2 cache size, (the
peak in the first graph is at 512 bytes).  Presumably this is the
effect of the smaller L1 data cache.</p>

<p>As to the hypothesis being tested, note that performance degrades
well in advance of the L2 cache size, most obviously in the random
access situation.  Given these results, the rule of thumb for using
the L2 cache with Java on Linux (while Gnome, Firefox, Gaim and Tomcat
are running) might be &quot;assume you get only 1/4 - 1/2 of the L2
cache&quot; :)</p>

<p>Finally, it is interesting that the throughput of sequential access
doesn't fail very badly as the working set approaches and exceeds the
size of cache.</p>
