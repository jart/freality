    <p>This little program is the crowning achievement of my
    programming career.</p>

    <p>It is the result of a bet with some friends.  We were having
    our typical language war.. Java vs. Ruby or Perl or whatever, and
    the example of a self-printing game of life was brought up.  Some
    guy had written one in Perl in 1KB of source.  I said that was
    pretty impressive, but I bet I could do it in Java too.  They said
    there was no way.  By the time we ironed out the details, I said I
    figured I could do it in 1.5KB, as Java would definitely be a bit
    more verbose than Perl.  I had 2 weeks to do it.</p>

    <p>I mailed them this solution (1 byte less than 1.5KB ;) after a
    few hours of work the next morning.  It starts with a splash
    screen with my username at work, and then runs a <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of
    Life</a> simulation with the splash as input.  It goes for a while
    and then ends up in a final repeating pattern.</p>
