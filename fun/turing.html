    <h1>A Turing Machine in Javascript, programmed with JSON</h1>

    <p>The following English description is an example task a
    classical
    <em>human</em> computer could follow to perform a precise
    computation, formalized and styled according
    to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
    Turing</a>'s method:</p>

<pre>"You are given a long paper/ticker tape with boxes drawn on it,
and within each one you can read or write symbols.  All boxes start
with 0 (zero) written in them.  To perform a computation, you maintain
a state of interaction with the tape in your head, starting with
the <b>start</b> state and then follow a "program" of instructions
that exactly specifies the calculation.  Like this:

In state <b>start</b>, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; now if the
symbol seen is 1, shift to the right, and change into
state <b>daisy</b>; in state <b>daisy</b>, if the symbol seen is 0,
write a 1 and change to state <b>cow</b>; if the symbol seen is a 1,
change to state <b>end</b>; in state <b>cow</b>, write a 1 and change
to state <b>end</b>; in state <b>end</b> stop"</pre>
    </p>

    <p>While this may seem obtuse, Turing supposed that by breaking
    down computations, even complex ones, into the simplest of parts,
    it might be possible to build a machine out of these parts, that
    could automatically run the program of instructions to carry out
    the computation.  He hypothesized a particular form for
    this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">"automatic
    machine"</a>, with a ticker tape and a computer interacting with
    it, as described above.  This idealized computer turned out to be
    able to represet a stunning variety of computational and
    algorithmic processes, and so became the model for successive
    attempts to actually build one.</p>

    <p>As the descendent computers and computer systems have
    developed, a wide variety of "languages" have also been developed
    to tranliterate the human program specification into a symbolic
    form with which the computer can be configured.</p>

    <p>A langauge known
    as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">JavaScript</a>
    (named for a type of programming called "scripting", and for an
    influential predecessor
    language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java">Java</a>),
    and an
    associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JavaScript
    Object Notation</a> (JSON), have emerged on the communications
    system known as the World Wide Web.</p>

    <p>And so, as a celebration of Alan Turing's 100th birthday and in
    recognition of one of the greatest outcomes of his work, here is a
    JSON programming interface to a Turing Machine written in
    JavaScript.  The program above is transliterated to get you
    started, but you can edit the program as you want to manipulate
    the tape as you want and, in principle, construct a program that
    is equivalent to any software running in the world if the tape is
    long enough, and your patience boundless.</p>
