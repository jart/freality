    <p>The program above is a transliteration of an example task a
    classical
    <em>human</em> computer could follow to perform a precise
    computation, formalized and styled according
    to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
    Turing</a>'s method:</p>

<pre>"You are given a long paper/ticker tape with boxes drawn on it,
and within each one you can read or write symbols.  All boxes start
with 0 (zero) written in them.  To perform a computation, you maintain
a state of interaction with the tape in your head, starting with
the <b>start</b> state and then follow a "program" of instructions
that exactly specifies the calculation.  Like this:

In state <b>start</b>, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; now if the
symbol seen is 1, shift to the right, and change into
state <b>daisy</b>; in state <b>daisy</b>, if the symbol seen is 0,
write a 1 and change to state <b>cow</b>; if the symbol seen is a 1,
change to state <b>end</b>; in state <b>cow</b>, write a 1 and change
to state <b>end</b>; in state <b>end</b> stop"</pre>
    </p>

    <p>While this may seem obtuse, Turing supposed that by breaking
    down computations, even complex ones, into the simplest of parts,
    it might be possible to build a machine out of these parts, that
    could automatically run the program of instructions to carry out
    the computation.  He hypothesized a particular form for
    this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">"automatic
    machine"</a>, with a ticker tape and a mechanical processor
    interacting with it, as described above.  This idealized computer
    turned out to be able to represet a stunning variety of
    computational and algorithmic processes, and so became the model
    for successive attempts to actually build one, which famously
    succeeded.</p>

    <p>As the descendent computers and computer systems have
    developed, a wide variety of "languages" have also been developed
    to tranliterate program specifications created by humans into
    symbolic/material forms that can be stored and processed directly
    by computers.</p>

    <p>After many generations and manifestations, a langauge known
    as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
    (named for a type of programming called "scripting", and for an
    influential predecessor
    language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>),
    and an
    associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JavaScript
    Object Notation</a> (JSON), have emerged as popular programming
    and data description languages (respectively) for the
    inter-networked computing and communication system known as the
    InterWebz.</p>

    <p>And so, in celebration of Alan Turing's 100th birthday and in
    recognition of one of the greatest outcomes of his work, here is a
    JSON programming interface to a Turing Machine written in
    JavaScript (see the linked <a href="turing.js">turing.js</a>).</p>

    <p>The program above is a placeholder to get you started, but you
    can edit the program as you want to manipulate the tape as you
    want and, in principle, construct a program that is equivalent to
    any software running in the world if the tape is long enough, and
    your patience boundless.</p>
