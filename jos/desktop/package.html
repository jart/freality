    <h1>Desktop</h1>

    <p>Existing desktop environments are extremely complex in terms of
    binary size, memory usage and especially development APIs. Of
    course, some of the complexity is warranted, as modern desktops
    serve a variety of different users and functions. But how much is
    needed and how much is needless weight?</p>

    <p>This desktop project is testing the limits of simplicity.
    Drawing upon the best libraries around, this desktop includes a
    web browser, e-mail client, instant messenger, media player,
    terminal and calculator, all with internationalization
    support... in 1573 lines of code! :)</p>

    <p>The desktop is cross-platform (except for the terminal, which
    requires a native shell), and on UNIX requires only an X display
    server to run. The current code is alpha, but rapidly
    progressing.</p>

    <p>Besides Java's built-in APIs, the system uses <a
    href="http://jaimlib.sf.net/">JAIM</a> for Instant Messenger
    connectivity to AOL's TOC network, and will soon incorporate <a
    href="http://jrex.mozdev.org/">JRex</a>, a Java wrapper for
    embedding Mozilla's GECKO rendering engine.</p>
