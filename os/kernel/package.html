    <h1>Kernel</h1>

    <p>Java requires a host operating system to provide a kernel and
    major sub-system interfaces at the level of linkable libraries.
    But typically, the host operating system is no optimized for this
    purpose.  For instance, a core system of perhaps tens of megabytes
    could suffice for a Java server application.  And for a GUI, all
    that is needed from the system is a frame-buffer and interface
    device support.</p>

    <p>The software below is a fledgling attemp to build a minimal
    Java host-OS.  This JOS Kernel uses a minimal Linux 2.6.11.7
    kernel with the following options turned on (built-in, no
    modules):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>P4 - SMP</li>
      <li>EXT3 on SATA disk</li>
      <li>DHCP netboot over TCP/IP on Intel Gigabit Ethernet</li>
      <li>Serial AT Keyboard & PS/2 Mouse - No USB; frame-buffer</li>
      <li>NFS 3 client</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The kernel is nice and lite at 1.5MB.</p>

    <p>The filesystem is derived from Fedora Core 3 and includes the
    basics in /lib, /bin, /sbin and /etc needed in a server
    environment.  The boot proceeds like this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>PXE network boot</li>
      <li>Kernel transfered and loaded</li>
      <li>Init ramdisk transfered and loaded</li>
      <li>Local disk, input devices and frame-buffer activated</li>
      <li>NFS activated, /usr and /home mounted.</li>
      <li>Local hard-disk configured for use as /var.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This filesystem is also very small at about 20MB or 10MB
    compressed.</p>

    <p>The near-term goal for this distribution is to provide coverage
    for most common server facilities used by simple Java server
    applications while reducing the distribution size as much as
    possible.  The long-term goal is to incrementally replace these
    system services with Java &quot;ports&quot; or re-writes.  These
    replacements will become sub-packages of this package.  Ideally,
    the entire kernel could be implemented in Java.</p>
