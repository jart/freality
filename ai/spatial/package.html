    <p style="margin-top: 1em">The graph on the left shows the
    performance of a single learner loop over many cycles of
    adaptation.  The goal of the learner is to find an input signal
    level from its environment of 1.1.  The environment being learned
    is a sinusoidal wave that has a peak value of 1.0.  The learner's
    output signal is the input to the sinusoidal function, so the
    learner is really trying to learn what output value maximizes its
    input.  The search method is to use the random signal to move the
    output value proportional to the current error.  The increase of
    the red line demonstrates that the learner does improve its
    control over time.</p>
