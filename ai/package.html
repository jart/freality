    <p>This package contains a framework for experimenting with
    different artificial intelligence approaches.  Subpackages contain
    implementations of each approach.</p>

    <p>The framework assumes a neural network structure that is built
    incrementally based on feedback during the learning experience
    (see <a href="http://faculty.ed.uiuc.edu/g-cziko/wm/">Cziko's
    book</a> for perceptual control feedback).  Each neuron receives
    sensory input, which is modifies according to an adaptive
    function, and finally an action is output.  A single neuron can
    interact directly with its environment, or multi-layer netowork of
    neurons can act in a delegated manner.</p>

    <p>See <a href="http://freality.org/~pablo/code/?package=test.ai">the unit tests for this package</a> for examples.
